## Notes
- Some labels that appear similar, are linked to the same page, and have the same descriptions exist. These are distinguished on HTML based on the label usage as of 2019, and it's possible that they are being used differently by editors. These are differently treated as separate labels. 
- Each brief description is created based on the current Wikipedia page, so there may be slight differences in usage and explanation from 2019 or earlier, as old labels might have been merged or split into a single label. 
- Labels without links are nonexistent label description pages, and their descriptions are inferred from examples in the dataset.
